## TECHNICAL DEBT

### PATCH

- We should reconsider the Config for the Api and make it less complex
  - We should have a definition for each single endpoint (`<resources>.getAll`, `<resources>.getOne`, ...)
  - Should create a service to build URL adding the paramaters (check if exists first)
- Make sure accessing data through an object ("filters") doesn't have caveats
  - We talk about the fact any change to one of the object properties has an impact on all objects
- Refactor the code to avoid passing "onSearch" throughout Component as it is a open door to deep nesting
- We must decide it we want to keep the implementation with the individual parameters passed to GameList
  - It creates so much noise and code smell
- We must refactor the code to make sure we keep it consistent by relying to a single source of thruth for GameQuery
- chore(config): Don't use the export default or make the export type consistent with UI_CONFIG

## IMPROVEMENTS IDEAS

### UX (Look & Feel)

- **!IMPORTANT**
  - The mobile version is not very appealing, we should have a burger menu and add some of the header features into the mobile menu
- Some GameCard have huge blank space we should either reduce the card or find a solution that doesn't hurt the UX

### Product

- Create an admin app that will help in manageming our data from our database. The goal is to update data when ever we want. For example,to update a release date.
- Create a Member are with authentication
- For members, get an alert when there is an update on a game (score, releases, ...)
- Bind the game to news links that could interest members
- Provide a search suggestion (Based on intern dabase and maybe ES)

### Technical

#### Design

- Create a layout to set a convenient spacing and add more pages

#### Data

- Create our own database that will contains game data. The database will store data from request made by users. The goal is to fill the database by time avoiding to crawl the API and be detected as a bot and get our access closed

#### Performance

##### Caching

- Cache result for a certain period to have making too much API calls. API calls are limited and are free until we reach a MAX_LIMIT

#### Images

- Prevent users from copying image directly with left click. Add an overlay
